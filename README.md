## Instructions:

Write a program in C to check if a number is prime (feel free to utilize https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number).

1. Define a integer variable *givenNumber*.

2. Use the scanf() function to read the integer variable *givenNumber*.

3. Use a conditional statement to find out if *givenNumber* is prime.

4. Print the output as *"The number is prime"* or *"The number is not prime"*.

## Extra Challenges (If You Have Extra Time):

- Utilize the math.h header file in your above solution.

- Consider some edge cases (e.g. user gives a floating point number). Create if-statements to respond appropriately.

- If you did not, create a function and name it 'checkIfPrime'. Move your code to it, and call it in the main function.

- Make 'checkIfPrime' a recursive function *'recursiveCheckIfPrime'* to check if a number is prime.
